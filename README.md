Cheap and simple solution for covering your printer's extrusions from the inside for the purpose of insulation. You can glue whatever flavor of foam you're using on your panels to them and then you'll have foam on your extrusions without using glue directly onto them. Just spray the foam with glue, lay the covers on top of it, and then just trying with a sharp blade using the cover as guide. Plus they cost you about 22 grams of plastic per meter of cover and you probably had to buy a huge roll of insulation foam for the panels that you've still got around.

The CAD is fully parametric and I suggest tweaking the parameters for the wings and printing a small piece of cover until you get a fit that snaps in place without breaking for your brand of extrusion (if the size seems right but it still breaks, tone down your fan). Once you get that right, figure out the sizes you need and print away! For some lengths you'll have to split it in 2, or print diagonally.
